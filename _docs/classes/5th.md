## Agenda

### Journal Entry

The Oxford Word of the Year for 2024 is “brain rot”, a term reflecting concerns about the negative effects of excessive digital consumption on mental well-being and intellectual capacity. With so much of our time spent online, it’s easy to see why this term resonates. Platforms filled with trivial content can entertain, but they might also distract us from more meaningful pursuits.

The shortlist of runner-ups adds further layers to this theme. Words like “slop” (low-quality, often AI-generated content) and “dynamic pricing” (highlighting economic shifts influenced by technology) show the power and pitfalls of a tech-driven world. Meanwhile, terms like “romantasy” and “lore” reflect how storytelling and creativity thrive in our digital spaces, blending genres and preserving traditions. Further, words like “demure” gained prominence through viral social media posts.

The selection of these words sparks questions about how technology shapes not only our language but also our daily lives. Are we losing something valuable in the process, or are we evolving into something new?

Write a paragraph or more reflecting on the following:
- What does the term “brain rot” mean to you? Do you feel like digital media has had a positive or negative impact on your mental well-being this year?
- How do runner-up words like “slop” and “lore” connect to your experience with technology in 2024?
- In your opinion, is it possible to balance meaningful engagement with technology while avoiding “brain rot”? If so, how?

Please be very “demure” and very mindful in your response. You can learn more about the the Oxford word of the year [here](https://corp.oup.com/word-of-the-year/).

## Agenda

### Journal Entry

**1. Prompt:**

Artificial intelligence (AI) continues to shape the way we live and work. This week, research one recent development in AI or another emerging technology (e.g., quantum computing, renewable energy tech, AR/VR, etc.). Summarize what you learned and share your thoughts on how it could impact society, your future career, or daily life.

**2. Follow-Up Questions:**

• What excites or concerns you about this technology?

• Can you think of an innovative way this technology could be used in your field of interest?

• What ethical considerations might need to be addressed as this technology evolves?

**Tip:**

Include the source of your research and make your response at least 5-7 sentences.

# November 18, 2024

The holiday season is a time of celebration, which often revolves around food. From harvesting crops to transporting goods to local stores, technology plays a major role in getting our holiday meals onto our tables. Check out this video: [Transforming the Food Industry with Technology](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtgCVfPdlNo).

**Prompt:** Reflect on how technology has changed the way we grow, distribute, and purchase food. In what ways does technology make food more affordable and accessible during the holiday season? Are there any negative effects of relying on technology for our food supply? Write a paragraph explaining your thoughts with examples.

# November 12, 2024

## Journal Entry

Choose a current event that interests you or impacts your community.

- In a paragraph, briefly summarize the event and explain how it relates to any of the concepts we’ve been learning in class (e.g., problem-solving, technology, or data analysis).

- In a second paragraph, reflect on how advancements in computer science or technology could play a role in addressing this event or similar issues in the future.

# November 4, 2024

## Journal Entry

In today’s digital world, sharing and publishing content online is more common than ever. Whether you’re contributing to a project, posting on social media, or submitting work for class, it’s important to think about the kinds of information you’re sharing and how it can be used.

Reflect on the following questions:

1. Why is it important to protect your personal and sensitive information when publishing online?

2. What steps can you take to ensure that the information you share on platforms like GitHub or social media remains secure?

3. Have you ever shared something online that you later realized was too personal? How would you handle that differently now?

4. How can you balance being open and collaborative in online spaces (like working with others on coding projects) while still protecting your privacy?

Write a paragraph or more considering these questions. Include examples of actions you can take to safeguard your own data, and reflect on why being cautious online is important for your personal and professional life.

The Benefits and Risks of Artificial Intelligence

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming industries like healthcare, education, and business, but it also comes with challenges. In this journal entry, write about how AI has the potential to help improve our lives. Then, consider some ways in which AI could cause harm, especially in areas like privacy, jobs, and security. Be sure to support your thoughts with examples for both sides.

- Helpful: How does AI improve efficiency and innovation in industries like healthcare, education, or transportation?
- Harmful: What are some risks AI poses, such as job automation, bias in algorithms, or cybersecurity threats?

Write two paragraphs—one focusing on the benefits and one on the potential risks.

You can use the following resources to inform your response:

- [How AI Works](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok-xpKjKp2g)

- **For Me:** What could I have done differently in drafting or explaining the instructions? Were there any parts that were unclear or confusing?
- **For You:** Did you encounter any challenges while following the steps? If so, what were they? What do you think may have been missed or misunderstood?

Please share your thoughts, as we’ll use this feedback to make sure everyone’s journals are properly set up moving forward.

As a class, we followed the instructions to set up our GitHub journals. However, only a small number of journals were set up in a way that I could access them. Let’s figure out together what went wrong and how we can improve the process.

- **For Me:** What could I have done differently in drafting or explaining the instructions? Were there any parts that were unclear or confusing?
- **For You:** Did you encounter any challenges while following the steps? If so, what were they? What do you think may have been missed or misunderstood?

Please share your thoughts, as we’ll use this feedback to make sure everyone’s journals are properly set up moving forward.

## Agenda

### Game Program & Design

#### 1. Journal Entry 

Think about a video game that you enjoy playing. In a paragraph or more, describe the aspects of that game that make it enjoyable or successful.

Consider elements like gameplay mechanics, graphics, storyline, music, and character design. Why do you think these aspects work well together, and how do they contribute to the overall experience of the game? Be as specific as possible in your analysis.

#### 2. Unity Essentials

### Mobile App Development

#### 1. Journal Entry (Due Friday)

Think about a mobile or web application that you use frequently. In a paragraph or more, describe the features of the app that make it useful or enjoyable to use.

Consider elements such as the user interface (UI), design, ease of use, functionality, performance, and any unique features that set it apart. How do these aspects work together to provide a good user experience? Be specific in your analysis, and think about how these ideas could inform your own app development projects.
